# Assignment 2

## Intro

Within the scope of this assignment, we are going to design a service with HTTP API for Point of Sales (POS) system.

## User Stories

> As a *cashier*, I would like to open a receipt so that, I can serve a customer.

> As a *cashier*, I would like to add items to an open receipt so that, I can calculate how much the customer needs to pay.

> As a *customer*, I would like to see a receipt with all my items so that, I know how much I have to pay.

> As a *cashier*, I would like to close the paid receipt so that, I can start serving the next customer.

> As a *store manager*, I would like to make sales reports so that, I can see the state of the store.

## Technical Details

- UI is out of scope (we only care for API)
- Concurancy is out of scope (single user, single request at a time).
- Registration/Authorization is out of scope (API is available publically without any restrictions)
- Receipt contains list of items sold with quantity, price at the time of sale and total price, as well as a grand total price of all items.
- Store can have multiple open receipts at the same time.
- Closed receipt cannot be modified.
- Sales reports contain revenue, and number of closed receipts.
- Use [SQLite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)) for persistence.
- Use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as a web framework.
- API reference that you need to implement is given in the last section.

## Linting/formatting

- Format and lint your code using `ruff`
- Check your static types with `mypy`

You can find configuration for these tools in playground project developed during sessions.

## Testing

Provide automated tests that will falsify regressions (change in behaviour) in your software artifacts.

## Grading

We will not grade solutions:
  - without decomposition
  - with needlessly long methods or classes
  - with code duplications

In all these cases you will automatically get 0% so, we sincerely ask you to 
not make a mess of your code and not put us in an awkward position.

Grade breakdown:
  - 20%: It is tested.
  - 20%: It is easy to change.
  - 20%: It demonstrates an understanding of software architecture.
  - 20%: It demonstrates an understanding of S.O.L.I.D principles.
  - 20%: It follows linting/formatting rules.

## Disclaimer

We reserve the right to resolve ambiguous requirements (if any) as we see fit just like a real-life stakeholder would.
So, do not assume anything, ask for clarifications.
